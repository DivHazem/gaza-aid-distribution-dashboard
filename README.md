# Gaza Aid Distribution Dashboard

![Dashboard Preview](Aid.png)

## 📊 Overview
This project presents a **Power BI dashboard** visualizing **simulated data** on the distribution of humanitarian aid in **Gaza**. It was developed to provide clear, data-driven insights into aid delivery efforts, covering:

- Number of beneficiary families and individual members
- Aid types (e.g., food, hygiene, health, winter support)
- Delivered vs. non-delivered aid
- Distribution trends over time
- Top contributors and most supported governorates

The dashboard supports **interactive filtering** by:
- Delivery date
- Governorate
- Aid type
- Delivery status

---

## 🌍 Purpose
This dashboard was built as part of a data visualization project to simulate how humanitarian organizations might track and monitor the efficiency and coverage of aid distribution across conflict-affected regions like Gaza.

It provides stakeholders with:
- Operational insights
- Performance monitoring
- Geographic distribution awareness
